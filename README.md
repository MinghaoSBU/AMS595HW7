README: How to Run the Code<br>
For every user, if you use Xcode, when you change the number needed for test, use Run directly. If using others, run main.cpp as you need.<br>
For problem 1, as placed in the end of the main function, you can enter the number after testing other function.<br>
For problem 2, auto run in need of problem 4.<br>
For problem 3, you can change the number of limit in the main function which test all functions print_fibonacci(4000000);<br>
For problem 4, you can change in the test functions as you need.<br>
test_isprime() test_factorize() test_prime_factorize()<br>
For problem 5, you can change the number of rows (10 as example) as you need in the main function. print_pascals_triangle(10)<br>
